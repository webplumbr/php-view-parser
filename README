Yet another PHP view parser that is meant to be simple and cacheable. No more ugly PHP tags and logic within the view template.
Let your frontend JavaScript/CSS developer breathe some fresh air!

=== Requirements ===
PHP 5.3.0 and above

This view parser makes use of PHP namespaces.

=== Getting Started ===
Take a look at index.php file and associated HTML example templates. You can uncomment examples in index.php and see how the parser 
works for iteration and included files.

The view parser implements a Cache interface and is offered with Memcached driver. So, if you are testing the Cacheability, make 
sure you have Memcached (libmemcached) library installed on your Server and set the server IP/name and port according to your settings.
